# Face-Mask-Detection-System
2020/2021 sem 2 - Soft Computing Individual Assignment Project - Face Mask Detection System - Detect if you are wearing a mask or not and detect the error that you are wearing your mask wrongly by using deep learning.

Original Project: https://github.com/rohanaggarwal45/Face-Mask-Detection-

In this assignment project, the trained model is able to detect faces and classify them into 5 classes, which is ‘With Mask’, ‘No Mask’, ‘Incorrect Mask (No
Cover Nose)’, ‘Incorrect Mask (No Cover Chin)’, and ‘Incorrect Mask (No Cover Nose and Mouth)’. Although there is still space for improvement on the accuracy, the direction
of the project is good, where we can detect the error when people are wearing the mask incorrectly.

Another problem in this project is the real time video will be seperated into one frame by one frame and it is not a very good idea to showcase it to users.

The solution proposed is in **[another project](https://github.com/Guoxuan99/Face-Detection-Colab)**
